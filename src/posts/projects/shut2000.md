shut2000 is a shutdown forcer for Windows 9x/2000, which really works because it’s based on a Microsoft documented issue on the `ExitWindowsEx` function.

## Download

* [shut2000.exe](https://cdn.dvuckovic.com/downloads/shut2000.exe)

## Requirements

* Microsoft® Visual Basic® 6.0 Run-Time files

## Usage

Usage is pretty simple. shut2000 behaves like a command-line application. All you have to do is to run shut2000 executable with one of the command-line switches:

```
-L <Log off>
-R <Restart>
-S <Shut down>
```

The easiest way to do this from Windows is to create a shortcut to `shut2000.exe` and to add a switch in target box after the quotes and a trailing space. Of course, setup program does this all by itself. In standard installation option are included four shortcuts:

| Shortcut name | Keyboard shortcut         | Action                 |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Log off       | Shift + Control + Alt + L | Log off                |
| Restart       | Shift + Control + Alt + R | Restart                |
| Shut down     | Shift + Control + Alt + S | Shut down              |
| shut2000      | Shift + Control + Alt + X | Option box (no switch) |

If shut2000 is ran without any switch it displays a short help on command-line switches which are actually action buttons and about info. In this window just click on desired button.

## Deprecated

This app is now deprecated, since XP brought it’s shutdown utility. Almost every result of this program can be met with this utility, using almost same command-line switches. Try `shutdown /?` in your command prompt.

## Source code

Complete [source code](https://github.com/dvuckovic/shut2000) for this app was written in Visual Basic 6, setup in NSIS.
