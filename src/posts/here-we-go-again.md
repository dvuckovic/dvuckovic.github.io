This is some n-th time I’m trying to start a weblog and maintain it regularly. On previous occasions I utilized some online applications, but in the end every one of them failed me in creating exactly what I want. Number of compromises simply outweighed conveniences and eventually I created robust [homepage](/) which could host all content.

But this approach has some drawbacks. I haven’t implemented an easy way for adding new content, and I ended up posting only major projects and things I worked on, so many web-worthy ideas were discarded along the way.

Cue Drupal, an open source content management system. I have worked with similar systems before, but they were limited. Since a client of mine had a site made with Drupal for me to maintain, I had to learn it. The learning curve was very, very steep, but I was pleasantly surprised how much one was able to build upon using 'hooks' system.

I decided to give it a shot, and set up a copy of Drupal for my blog purposes, and theme it as close as possible to my site. I hope you will find it interesting.

_UPDATE:_ Drupal has been dropped in favor of VuePress, since it has a much lower footprint and forgoes the database in favor of flat file CMS, with a static build. Go JS!
