# Privacy Policy

At _dvuckovic.com_ (“website”) one of my main priorities is the privacy of you — my visitors. This Privacy Policy document outlines types of information that is collected and recorded by the website and how is it used.

If you have additional questions or require more information about this Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact me via the Email link in the footer.

## Log Files

The website follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services’ analytics. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for administering the site and resolving issues with it.

## Cookies

“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.

Unlike other websites, this website does _NOT_ use cookies for internal tracking purposes. However, several service providers that I rely upon for operating this website _DO_ use this technology, and you can find all the details outlined below.

Please note that you may prevent the storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser software.

### Google Analytics

The _4_ Google Analytics cookies provide me with data about visitor usage patterns on the website. They allow me to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the site when they’re using it. This helps me to improve the way the website works, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily. The visitor remains anonymous.

Further information about handling user data, can be found in [the data protection declaration of Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Google Maps

The embedded Google Map on the website sets _3_ cookies known as `NID`, `PREF` and `khcookie`. These cookies allow Google Maps to remember which browser you are using and what preferences you have set when you view maps.

Further information about handling user data, can be found in [the data protection declaration of Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
